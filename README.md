# GitHub Feed Icons [![tag](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/StylishThemes/GitHub-Feed-Icons.svg)](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Feed-Icons/tags)

A simple userstyle that adds icons to the news feed.

Please be aware that most feed entries have a generic class name applied:
* An open pull request will show an issue opened icon.
* A closed pull request, either merged or unmerged, will show an issue closed icon.
* A reopened issue or pull request will show an issue reopened icon.
* Issue and commit (review) comments will both show a comment icon.
* Wiki edit and creation will show a book icon.
* Repo creation and a repo made public will show the same repo icon.

## Preview

This userstyle works great along side our [compact feed style](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Compact-Feed), as seen in these screenshots.
